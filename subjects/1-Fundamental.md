There are other reason why system fail and can affect the operation of hardware and firmware and lead to system failure. Then can lead to:
- loss of money

# Testing and debugging
<a id="2"></a>

|testing |debugging|
|:----|:----|
|Identifies failures| Investigates the cause of a fault (root cause)|
|Confirms whether a failure has been fixed| Fixes software if necessary|
| |Checks the defect has been fixed|
| |Steps through program code|
|-- |-- |
| by the tester |by the developer |

|TRUE|FALSE|
|:----|:----|
|Failures can be caused by environmental conditions such as radiation|A defect is produced as a result of system failure|
|Defects, bugs and faults are the same thing|Failures can cause bugs|
| |Faults always cause system failures|

# Regression and retesting

|REGRESSION|RETESTING|
|:----|:----|
|Regression testing is checking that there are no additional problems in previously tested software. |retesting is demonstrating that the reported defect has been fixed.|
