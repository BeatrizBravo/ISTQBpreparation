|Test Procedures are deliverable products in the software development process.|It is executed as a part of the test cycle or regression.|
|The order of execution is fixed.|The order of execution may not be important.|
|Test procedure contains end to end test cases.|Test suite contains all new features and regression test cases.|
|Test procedures are coded in a new language called TPL(Test Procedure language).|Test suite contains manual test cases or automation scripts.|
