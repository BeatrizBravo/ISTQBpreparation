|It is a step by step by procedure that is used to test an application|It is a set of instructions to test an application automatically.|
|The term Test Case is used in the manual testing environment.|The term Test Script is used in automation testing environment.|
|It is done manually.|It is done by scripting format.|
|It is developed in the form of templates.|It is developed in the form of scripting.|
|Test case template includes Test Suit ID, Test Data, Test procedure, Actual results, Expected results etc.|In Test Scrip,t we can use different commands to develop script.|
|Is used to test an application.|It is also used to test an application.|
|It is the base form to test an application in sequence.|Once we develop, the script will run it multiple times until the requirement is changed.|
|Example: We need to verify the login button in an application,|Example: We want to click an image button in an application.|
|The steps include:|The script includes:|
|a) Launch the application.|a) Click the Image Button.|
|b) Verify if the login button is displaying or not.| |

|TEST PROCEDURE|TEST SUITE|
|:----|:----|
|It is a combination of test cases to test an application.|It is a group of test cases to test an application.|
|It is a logical grouping based on the functionality.|There is no logical grouping based on the functionality.|
|Test Procedures are deliverable products in the software development process.|It is executed as a part of the test cycle or regression.|
|The order of execution is fixed.|The order of execution may not be important.|
|Test procedure contains end to end test cases.|Test suite contains all new features and regression test cases.|
|Test procedures are coded in a new language called TPL(Test Procedure language).|Test suite contains manual test cases or automation scripts.|
|Creation of Test Procedures is based on the end to end test flow.|Test suites are created based on the cycle or based on the scope.|

**Behaviour-based/  BLACK BOX testing type:**

|Technique|Definitions|Components of a Specific Type|more|Example|
|:----|:----|:----|:----|:----|
|Equivalence Partitioning|Divides input data into PARTITIONS or CLASSES that are treated and tested in the same way.|Partitions are:<br> Invalid - valid - invalid|.-  reduce the number of test cases required to test a system. <br>- identify defects related to input data. <br>- identify defects related to output data.|If a field accepts values between 1 and 100, then the valid partition is between 1 and 100, and the invalid partition is outside this range.|
|Boundary Value Analysis|Tests values at the BOUNDARIES between partitions (of input domains).|two value approach <br>- three value bondaries         <br><br>      *If we cannot apply EP we cannot Appy BAV. Because we apply in the similar data|.- identify defects related to input data.<br> - identify defects related to output data.|If a field accepts values between 1 and 100, then the boundary values are 1, 100, and values just above or below these numbers.|
|Decision Table Testing|Tests combinations of inputs that affect program DECISIONS (that result in different outputs).|Columm = Business rule   <br>   -  row = Conditions (input)  & Acctions|.-identify defects related to business rules. <br>- identify defects related to decision making.|A decision table can be used to test a program that calculates the price of a product based on its type and quantity.      <br>  -If a system has two inputs: X and Y, and two outputs: A and B, then decision table testing would test all possible combinations of X and Y that result in A or B.
|
|State Transition Testing|Tests how a program behaves when it CHANGES from one STATE to another.|Elements:*State(previous history/static =circle) * State transition(change  /arrow) *Event  (triger for a change) *Action (response to event /output)   <br> State transition diagram (show only the valid transitions and exclude the invalid transitions) - State table (show all valid transitions and invalid transitions beteen states|.-Identify defects related to state changes. <br>- identify defects to transitions between states.|A program that controls a traffic light can be tested by simulating the transition from green to yellow to red.  <br> -If a system has three states: A, B, and C, then state transition testing would test how the system behaves when it moves from A to B, B to C, C to A, etc.|
|Use Case Testing|Tests how a program behaves in response to USER INTERACTIONS and ACTIVITIES <br>(preconditions, postconditons and natural language)|ACTOR = human user, external llhardware, other system  <br>  SUBJECTS = system where use case is applied. Use Case Diagram, Test Cases.|.- identify defects related to user interactions with the software.<br> -  identify defects related to user requirements.|A program that allows users to create accounts can be tested by simulating the creation of an account with valid and invalid inputs.|

| **why** does decision table testing **USE limited entry** decision tables?                                                                                           | Decision table testing uses limited entry decision tables to **reduce the number of test cases needed to cover all possible combinations of conditions and actions**. Limited entry decision tables are created by **removing columns that do not affect the outcome of the decision**. This technique **helps to decrease the number of test cases** required for testing, making it more efficient and manageable.<br>Limited entry decision tables are used to **eliminate impossible combinations of conditions and actions**. By removing these impossible combinations, the **number** of test cases can be significantly **reduced** while still **ensuring coverage of all important combinations of conditions**.<br>The **goal** of decision table testing is to **identify all the important combinations of conditions and actions**, and **limited entry** decision tables help achieve this objective by focusing on the relevant combinations. This technique **helps** in **find**ing any **gaps** in the **requirements** and **ensures** that the **behavior of the software is thoroughly tested**.<br>**Limited entry decision tables** are **use**d in decision table testing to **optimize test case selection** by eliminating impossible combinations of conditions and actions, reducing the number of test cases required while still achieving coverage of important combinations.<br> |                  |
| Describe how **test cases** are **identified** from decision tables.                                                                                                 | Test cases are identified from decision tables **by examining the combinations of _conditions and actions_ in the table**.<br> Each row in the **decision** table represents a **unique combination of conditions**, and the corresponding **actions** indicate the **expected behavior** of the system for that combination.<br>To identify test cases from a decision table, the tester looks for the different combinations of conditions that need to be tested. This involves selecting test cases that cover all possible combinations of conditions and actions in the decision table. <br><br> The common approach is to select at least one test case for each decision rule in the table. A decision rule is a unique combination of conditions that leads to a specific set of actions. By covering all decision rules, the tester ensures that all important combinations of conditions are tested.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |                  |
