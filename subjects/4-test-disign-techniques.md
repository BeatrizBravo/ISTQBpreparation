|The term Test Case is used in the manual testing environment.|The term Test Script is used in automation testing environment.|
|It is done manually.|It is done by scripting format.|
|It is developed in the form of templates.|It is developed in the form of scripting.|
|Test case template includes Test Suit ID, Test Data, Test procedure, Actual results, Expected results etc.|In Test Scrip,t we can use different commands to develop script.|
|Is used to test an application.|It is also used to test an application.|
|It is the base form to test an application in sequence.|Once we develop, the script will run it multiple times until the requirement is changed.|
|Example: We need to verify the login button in an application,|Example: We want to click an image button in an application.|
|The steps include:|The script includes:|
|a) Launch the application.|a) Click the Image Button.|
|b) Verify if the login button is displaying or not.| |


|TEST PROCEDURE|TEST SUITE|
|:----|:----|
|It is a combination of test cases to test an application.|It is a group of test cases to test an application.|
|It is a logical grouping based on the functionality.|There is no logical grouping based on the functionality.|
|Test Procedures are deliverable products in the software development process.|It is executed as a part of the test cycle or regression.|
|The order of execution is fixed.|The order of execution may not be important.|
|Test procedure contains end to end test cases.|Test suite contains all new features and regression test cases.|
|Test procedures are coded in a new language called TPL(Test Procedure language).|Test suite contains manual test cases or automation scripts.|
|Creation of Test Procedures is based on the end to end test flow.|Test suites are created based on the cycle or based on the scope.|
