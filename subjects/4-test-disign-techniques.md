By testing values near the boundaries, testers can identify any defects or issues that may arise due to boundary conditions.<br><br>For example, if a partition has a valid **range** from **1 to 10**, selecting test **values** that are **just below 1** and **just above 10** would be considered "as close as possible to a boundary." **These values** would **help** uncover any issues that may occur when the system handles values at the lower and upper limits of the partition.<br><br>By testing values near the boundaries, testers can increase the effectiveness of their testing and improve the chances of detecting defects that may occur at the critical points of the system.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |                                                                     |

This involves selecting test cases that cover all possible combinations of conditions and actions in the decision table. <br><br> The common approach is to select at least one test case for each decision rule in the table. A decision rule is a unique combination of conditions that leads to a specific set of actions. By covering all decision rules, the tester ensures that all important combinations of conditions are tested.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |                                                                     |

Test cases are designed to verify that the system handles these invalid transitions correctly, such as by displaying error messages or rejecting the transition.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |                                                                     |

It involves dividing the input data into partitions or equivalence classes, where all the members of a partition are expected to be processed in the same way. Equivalence partitions can be created for both valid and invalid values. The goal of equivalence partitioning is to achieve maximum coverage by selecting at least one value from each partition. This technique is applicable at all test levels and helps detect gaps and deviations from the requirements.<br>                                                                                                                     **use case** testing is a technique that derives test cases from use cases. Use cases describe interactions between actors (users, external hardware, or other components) and the system being tested. Each use case specifies a behavior that the system can perform in collaboration with actors. Use case testing focuses on testing the defined behaviors, including basic, exceptional, alternative, and error handling scenarios. The coverage in use case testing is measured by the number of use case behaviors tested divided by the total number of use case behaviors.<br><br>**Equivalence partitioning** is a technique that focuses on dividing input data into partitions to achieve maximum coverage =>determine the inputs and outputs that will be used when planning test cases<br> **Use case testing** focuses on testing the defined behaviors described in use cases => focuses on how the system is used and testing the functionality |                                                                     |
