|Benefits of Test Independence|Drawbacks of Test Independence|
|:----|:----|
|Testers can provide an OBJECTIVE and UNBIASED view of the software quality and risks|Testers may be ISOLATED from the development team, leading to a lack of collaboration, delays in providing feedback, or an adversarial relationship|
|Testers can apply different SKILLS, EXPERIENCE, and PERSPECTIVES than the developers, leading to more effective and efficient testing|Testers may have LIMITED access to project information, resources, or support from the development team, leading to difficulties in understanding the requirements, design, or implementation|
|Testers can avoid the ASSUMPTIONS, OVERSIGHTS, or BLIND SPOTS that the developers may have, leading to more thorough and diverse testing|Testers may have HIGHER costs or overheads associated with test independence, such as hiring external testers, managing contracts, or transferring knowledge|
