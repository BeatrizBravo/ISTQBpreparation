# Intro
Testing as part of the overal software development process.


# Test Model 

|Test Model | Description | Advantages | Disadvantages |
|-------|-------------|-----------------------|-------------------------------|
| V-model | A linear model where each phase of development is completed before moving onto the next phase, with testing at each stage | - Improves quality as testing occurs at each stage, leading to fewer defects in later phases<br>- Good for linear projects where requirements are well understood | - Rigid, less suitable for projects with evolving requirements<br>- Difficult to make changes once a stage has been completed |
| Iterative model | A cyclic model where a small set of requirements is developed and tested in each iteration, gradually building up the full system | - Good for projects with evolving requirements<br>- Allows for early testing and feedback<br>- Easier to make changes | - May not work well for projects with fixed deadlines or budgets<br>- May require more resources or time due to the iterative nature |
