# Introduction 


The ISTQB Foundation-level certification is a popular software testing certification. To become certified, you need to understand key concepts and terms related to software testing and apply this knowledge in practice. 
# Why here?

This repository will record my journey and progress in studying for the exam. 

<br>

The repository is going to include a definitions, comparison tables to understand the main concepts and terms related to testing and I will answers the  check of understanding questions from the book "Software Testing" (4th edition) by Brian Hambling (ed.), Brian Hambling, Peter Morgan, Angelina Samaroo, Geoff Thompson, and Peter Williams.

My hope is that this repository will be a useful resource for others preparing for the ISTQB Foundation exam and that it will provide a structured and efficient way to cover the necessary concepts and terminology.
