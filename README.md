# Introduction 


The ISTQB Foundation-level certification is a popular software testing certification. To become certified, you need to understand key concepts and terms related to software testing and apply this knowledge in practice. 
# Why here?

This repository will record my journey and progress in studying for the exam. 

<br>

The repository is going to include definitions - flashcards and comparison tables to understand the main concepts and terms related to testing and 
<br>I will answers the  **check of understanding questions** of each chapter of the book "Software Testing" (4th edition) by Brian Hambling (editor) and others.

My hope is that this repository will be a useful resource for others preparing for the ISTQB Foundation exam and that it will provide a structured and efficient way to cover the necessary concepts and terminology.
